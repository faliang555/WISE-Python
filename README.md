## Anaconda installation

1. Go to [Anaconda's website](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).
2. Click on your operating system.
3. Choose Python 3.7 version. I also recommend checking the box for the "Add Anaconda3 to my PATH environment variable" option.
4. Follow the instructions. 
5. Done!

## Anaconda Online
This should be the last resort. If you are unable to install Anaconda and do not have access to jupyter notebook on your computer, please use the online jupyter notebook from https://jupyter.org/try.
